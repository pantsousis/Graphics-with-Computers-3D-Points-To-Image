# Graphics-with-Computers-3D-Points-To-Image
This assignment is a project converts 3D coordinates points to an image on the pc. It is the expansion of project 2D points to image in my github.

In essence, given that we have the 3D points of an object, the colors of each vertex and which vertices form a triangle, we can convert the data into an object.
In this project, we can also manipulate the camera view from which we view the world and the position and orientation of the object through mathematical formulas.
The data given are for a racoon and a certain camera view and manipulations. However, feel free to test it with your own data.
This project was developed as an assignment for AUTh.
